What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a .git hidden directory to store the metadata for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area tells git that these are files you want to be tracked prior to 
	executing a git commit. The working directory contains ALL the files physically 
	located on your workstation within that folder. The staging area allows you to work
	on a subset of the working directory instead of just the whole thing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	You can use the staging area for those changes you actually want to commit
	even though you may have made more changes in the working directory to 
	support the change or make additional changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches help when you want to try something that you don't want to affect
	your main branch. For instance, if you were trying out new features, but you 
	wanted to keep a working copy of the main branch you would use a branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams show you how commits are related and point out where there may be 
	unreachable commits

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	Merging two branches goes back to the point where the two branches diverged and
	then replays each commit for each branch in the order dictated by the timestamp
	on the files in the repository.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	The big benefit of automatic merging (when possible) is that git keeps track of the
	order of the changes and lets you go back to them if necessary. The downside is that if
	git can't automatically merge them you'll need to merge them manually which means
	better understanding the changes made (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).
