When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1. When you're collaborating with other people
    2. When you want access to your work from multiple locations
    3. When you want to back up your work in case your current location is lost/damaged

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I  may have changes in process that I am not ready to commit and I don't 
	want to have them overwritten. Others may also be working on the project
	on features that I'm not ready to add to my local repository. Also, there
	may be conflicts between local and remote that need human interaction to
	resolve.
